# fastest-matrices

This project benchmarks the following libraries:
- [hmatrix](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hmatrix)
- [dense-linear-algebra](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dense-linear-algebra)
- [numhask](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/numhask)
- [matrix](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/matrix-0.3.6.1)

instead of relying on hackage, the project's dependencies fetch the libraries directly from github (see `stack.yaml`).

To run:

(allocation)
`stack build :bench-alloc && stack exec bench-alloc`

(runtime)
`stack build :bench-runtime && stack exec bench-runtime`

The implementations of the "naive C" parts can be found in `/naive`. They were compiled with `-O3`
