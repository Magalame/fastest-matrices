# fastest-matrices

This project benchmarks the following libraries:
- hmatrix
- dense-linear-algebra
- numhask
- matrix

instead of relying on hackage, the project's dependencies fetch the libraries directly from github (see `stack.yaml`).

To run:

(runtime)
`stack build :bench-alloc && stack exec bench-alloc`

(allocation)
`stack build :bench-runtime && stack exec bench-runtime`

## Results
