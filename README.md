Relevant details:

- the implementations of the "naive C" parts can be found in `/naive`. They were compiled with `-O3`
- the `massiv` benchmarks use the `Primitive` representation, which *seems* to be the fastest among what massiv offers
- the benchmarked functions from DLA are taken from the `Fast` module when available
- the `norm` function is called on `n*n` vectors
- instead of relying on hackage, the project's dependencies fetch the libraries directly from github (see `stack.yaml`).

Formely included:
- `bed-and-breakfast` (abandoned because too slow)
- `matrices` (abandoned because too slow, also see https://github.com/kaizhang/matrices/issues/8)


TODO:
- have a cleaner/more abstract interface for the benches
